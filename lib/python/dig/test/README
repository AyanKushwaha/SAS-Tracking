In order to run these tests, add a soft link in the lib/python directory as in

ln -s /carm/components/dig/master/dig/test/ .

It may also be necessary to add a link to the latest dig/carmensystems as well

ln -s /carm/components/dig/master/dig/carmensystems/ .

... but as this will override the carmensystems from the user, it probably needs to be
removed as soon as the tests have been run.

assuming that your current working directory are in sk_cms_user/lib/python
