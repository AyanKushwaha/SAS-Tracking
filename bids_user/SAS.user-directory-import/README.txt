A "crew filter file" is exported from a system called JCR, which is then passed on to the Bid 6 import (and this user-directory-import application).
In the import file, there should be exactly one role, which is a Cacs role name, found in cacspolicy.xml.

Admin users are handled via the same mechanism - manually creating import files.
