      <div class="Heading_4"><a name="23261">Why was my bid not granted?</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="23262">There are many possible reasons why a bid is not granted. The main reasons are that the bid was either illegal or impossible to assign, or simply that there was a better solution.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="23263">Sometimes the explanation is more complex. For example, although your bid points would be higher if the bid was granted, other crew members may benefit more from their possible rosters when your bid was rejected. Remember that the system tries to find the best total solution. See also </a><span class="Xref"><a href="BidsAndBidPoints.html" title="Bids and bid points">Bids and bid points</a></span>.</div>
      <div class="Heading_4"><a name="23267">Why was my friend’s bid granted, but not mine?</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="23268">See above. Another reason could be that the resource you provide was more scarce than your friend’s. If, for example, you are an instructor and the training problem was particularly difficult this planning period, the system maybe had to reject more of your bids than your captain colleague’s.</a></div>
      <div class="Heading_4"><a name="23269">Why did another crew member get what I wanted, without asking for it?</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="23270">When the system generates rosters the first priority is to cover production, the second is to create stable rosters that can handle delays, etc. After that, bids are taken into consideration. In this complex process situations as the one in the question might occur.</a></div>
      <div class="Body_Text"><a name="23271">If you and your colleagues move around a few pairings and find what looks like a better solution, remember that to ensure stability and other desired roster characteristics planners apply a lot of rules in addition to the legality rules.</a></div>
