Intro
-----

Word will no longer be used as the primary documentation tool within the project. This
is a step towards an updated and improved documentation. The plan is to move the documentation
to the Sphinx during a longer period of time. There are many advantages like since it is based
on ordinary test files, this includes that the documentation may be easily versions mangaged and
merged, it is easy to view differences. It is also possible to output different formats like
HTML and PDF automatically.

There are still some layout problems with Sphinx that will be fixed over time. This mostly 
relates to pdf and the following problems has been identified:
 
 * There is duplicate paragraph and figure numbering
 * Figures are not correctly placed.
