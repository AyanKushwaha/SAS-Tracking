About this manual
=================

This manual provides information on how to install, configure and maintain
the SAS CMS2 system. It is mainly written for system administrators, but
developers and expert users will sometimes change or add configurations
described in this manual.

Familiarity with Unix and Unix-like operating systems is necessary. The
manual does not explain how to configure or install operating systems and
third party products in general, only settings that are required by the SAS CMS2 system.

The manuals chapters can be grouped into four sections:

 * Overview chapters useful for understanding the system and its configuration: :ref:`system_overview`, :ref:`common_configuration`.
 * Chapters describing common functionality and how programs are started and monitored: :ref:`session_server`, :ref:`sysmond`.
 * Reference chapters for specific programs or tasks: :ref:`system_configuration`, :ref:`installation`, :ref:`maintenance_and_administration`

 * Customer specific installation and maintenance instructions.

This manual describes the general configuration. It is not a step by step description of a
customer specific installation. A customer installation may use additional
settings and help scripts not mentioned in this manual.
