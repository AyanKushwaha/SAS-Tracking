      <text>
	This entity stores crew publication orders initiated by external
	interfaces handling incoming events like time table changes (ASM/SSM)
	and AC rotation changes. Records are created by external interfaces
	(DIG channels) as events occur that require crew to be re-published.
	A background studio process polls the table and publishes crew by
	performing a regular save operation on a periodical basis. Once
	crew is published, the studio process removes the corresponding
	records. For more details please refer to RFI 54. 
	In order not to lose any events added during the save/publish 
	process, a sequence number is used as key in this table.
	Dave sequence seq\_ext\_pub is used to generate unique numbers for the id field.
