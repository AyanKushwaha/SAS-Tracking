When preparing for a new release:
  * Create a new migration folder in data/migration named after the release, for example r24_sas1905.
  * Then copy run_data.sh to the new folder so that features that need it can add migration tasks to it.
  * Only copy run_schema.sh to the new folder if/when model changes have been made.
