Please note that SAS41 contains a schema change, dropping an old table not used any more, as it was also meant to contain other schema changes which have now been withdrawn.

This cleaning up is no hurry, and is preferrably done in next releaes contains important schema changes.

We leave the release with having done the XML file change, but not run the change. Next time run_schema is run, it will also do this table dropping.
