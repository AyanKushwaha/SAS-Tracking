/* If a crew has the following days off and follows other 
   restrictions around free weekends, these periods will count as
   free weekend.

   This table lists the dates and the end date is not included in the 
   weekend. Thus crew must be off both the 4th and the 5th if the
   interval is 04Apr2007, 06Apr2007.

   Dates are interpreted in homebase time.
