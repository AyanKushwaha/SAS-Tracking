 * Purpose:
 *   This module contains flight crew specific meal rules used in 
 *   Carmen Crew Pairing and as studio only in Carmen Crew Rostering and 
 *   Carmen Crew Tracking respectively.
 *
 * Sections:
 *   1: Mealstop rules
 *
 * Created by:
 *   Hasse Eliasson, 2009May6
 *
 * Major changes:
 *   Hasse Eliasson, 2009May6:
 *     Rules were moved here from rules_indust_ccp_fc, so that they
 *     could be redefined for Tracking, in a sub module using inheritance.

/*
** Rule:
**    Max consecutive days with meal on board
**
** Description:
**    Check that the number of days with one or several meals during flight
**    is less than limit.
**
** NB! Only days where the meal load occurs with 5:45 of check-in, thus
** satisfying the rule for a meal break within 5:45 of check-in, are counted.
** If a meal stop satisfies the 5:45 rule, and there is a meal load on a later
** leg, the day is not counted.
**
** Agreement:
**    FC 13:25 8
**
** NB! K12 - rule no longer applies.

/*
** Rule:
**    Min nr of meal breaks in duty
**
** Description:
**    The rule checks that at least two meal-breaks are planned
**    if time between first block-off and last block-on is more than 10:00, 
**    and there is no  meal stop planned to start <= 10:00 hrs. from block-off.
**
**    If the meal stop starts > 5:45 from check-in, so that a meal load is
**    required to saisfy the 5:45 rule, the meal stop following will also be
**    allocated, so there will be 2 meal breaks
**    If the meal stop starts <= 5:45 from check-in, then there is no need for
**    any further meal breaks.
**
** Agreement:
**    FC Trial agreement
**
**    4ExNG: replaced by a new common rule in rules_meal_ccp
