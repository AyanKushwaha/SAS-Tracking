# This file is ONLY used as a workaround for a broken mail functionality
# in acroread in RHEL6. acroread uses the binary mail that it finds in 
# the path and it mustbe compatible with bsd-mailx functionality
# This script will be put in the path before launching acroread. This will
# call bsd-mailx if it is installed and mail if it is not.
#
# NOTE! This should be considered a temporary solution because acroread is 
# not supported on Linux and Red Hat has announced that bsd-mailx will not
# be available after RHEL6.
# See Jira AYSD-102 or SKSD-2712 for more information regarding this.
